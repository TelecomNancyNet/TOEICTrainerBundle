            <p>The reading part is composed of three different exercises. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The first exercise consists in filling the 
                    blanks in incomplete sentences.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the second exercise, we have to fill the 
                    blanks in a whole text.
                </li>
                <li>
                    And finally in the last exercise, we have multiple 
                    documents and questions, of which you have to answer 
                    correctly using the information in the documents.
                </li>
            </ul>
